# E2Store

Simple Vite + React + TypeScript starter for the E2Store project.

## Getting started (local development)

Prerequisites: Node.js and a package manager (npm, pnpm, or bun).

Quick start:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Editing files

Edit files locally with your preferred IDE and commit changes. Standard GitHub workflows apply.

## Technologies

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Deployment

Deploy to any static hosting provider that supports Vite-built assets (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.). Build with:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then serve the `dist/` folder with your chosen platform.

## Notes

Removed references to external tooling and project-specific hosting links. If you want custom deployment instructions, tell me which provider you prefer and I can add them.
